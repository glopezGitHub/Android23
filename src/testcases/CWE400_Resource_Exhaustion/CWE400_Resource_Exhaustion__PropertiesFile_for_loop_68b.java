 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: PropertiesFile Read count from a .properties file (in property named data)
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: for_loop
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
 *    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
 * Flow Variant: 68 Data flow: data passed as a member variable in the "a" class, which is used by a method in another class in the same package
